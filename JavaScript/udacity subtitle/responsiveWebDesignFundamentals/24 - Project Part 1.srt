00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's put your newfound
knowledge to the test.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,150
For this question I want you to make
some updates to the Hometown Project.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,210
If you need the starter files,
check out the instructor notes for

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,200
instructions on downloading that.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,520
Here we can see what it
looks like right now.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,320
We've got two columns, text and

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,750
images, and we've got the weather and
sports scores.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,110
When we resize the page,

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,270
it's pretty clear that the content
is no longer fitting the browser.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,140
Let's go ahead and make it responsive.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,330
First, add a meta view port to the page,
and

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,460
don't forget to set the initial scale.

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,790
Then I want you to make any
adjustments to the CSS in markup, so

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,080
that everything displays
in a single column.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,970
Be sure to use relative widths, so

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,190
that things stretch to fit
across any viewport width.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,570
And then finally,
check your touch targets and

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,100
make sure that they're big enough.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,890
Once you've made your changes, test
your site across different viewports.

20
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,880
Try it on phones, tablets,
and different desktops.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,660
And when you're done,
here's what it should look like.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,290
Notice, to start off with,
everything's in one column.

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,650
And when I resize the page, the content
reflows to fit the new viewport.

24
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,710
And of course, my buttons are nice and
big and easy to press.
