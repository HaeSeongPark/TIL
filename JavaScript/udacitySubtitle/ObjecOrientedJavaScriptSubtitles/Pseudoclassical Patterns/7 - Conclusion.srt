When people learn that JavaScript supports so many different class patterns,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,040
they frequently wonder which one they should be using or

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,590
which one is best and sadly there just isn't an answer to this question.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,570
As a language, JavaScript takes remarkably few stances and tends to

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,430
make the internal features visibly available to the programmer to play with.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,210
So rather than rights and wrongs their really only techniques and options.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,460
What we can do though is discuss the advantages and

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,400
disadvantages of the different techniques to help inform the decisions that

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,790
we will make about which patterns to use on a case by case basis.
