1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's look at this first line and what it's going to do for us.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,740
It's going to create an object that delegates the car.prototype which is

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,039
what we're already doing.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,430
That means we can get rid of the part where we were doing that ourselves.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,990
It also seems to be assigning the result of that object creation to

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,290
the keyword this.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,030
Now, even though you couldn't possibly write this line of code in your own

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,310
programs, the interpreter is capable of finding values to the keyword this.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,570
It kind of makes sense and

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,150
is in keeping with our understanding of what the keyword this is used for.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,450
The intention of the keyword this is to be a convenient way of referring to

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,690
whatever the target object is in some object oriented function call.

13
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,820
This function call is pretty object oriented.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,950
The intent is that we're going to build a new thing.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,230
So it makes a lot of sense that whatever that new thing is could be

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,030
the target of the keyword this.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,490
Now that we have a way of referring to a brand-new object that's created to

18
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,760
delegate to the car prototype,

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,150
we might as well get rid of all of these new obj variables that we introduced.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,680
We can just instead use the keyword this.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,260
Lastly, we can tell that this return statement that will be

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,610
inserted by the interpreter seems to duplicate what's being done

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,470
above in the line that we wrote.

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,120
It's unnecessary to have two return statements, and, in fact,

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,260
the way this code would operate, we should never be able to reach the last line

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,210
since the second to last line would already have returned from the function.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,050
We can get rid of the return statement that we wrote, as well, and

28
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:24,470
just trust that this inserted return statement will do the work we need.

29
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,890
We're done refactoring to avoid the duplication between the code we had

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,920
written and the code that got inserted for us.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,900
But remember, this code is just a mental note to remind us what

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,470
the keyword new does.

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,130
So let's get rid of those notes because we know they are not actually going to

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,100
show up anywhere in our program.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,730
Let's take away the extra white space so

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,570
that we can see it written more clearly.

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,140
This is what we would expect to type when we're making a pseudo classical class.
