1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,050
These two lines look likely to be repeated in every prototypal class.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,270
After all, a prototypal class needs some object that it can operate on and then,

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,030
it needs to make sure that, that object delegates to some prototype object and

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,430
lastly, of course, it needs to return that object.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,090
So we can expect that all of these operations are going to happen in

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,650
every single prototypal class.
