00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:04,407
The answer is if we use car dot methods as the prototype for new instance, then

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:09,030
fell property look ups to those instances, we'll fall through to car do methods.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,340
And thus every instance will appear to have a .move method.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,960
Even if we don't manually copy them over on this line.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,780
That means, we can get rid of this line entirely.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,160
We do still need to make sure this load property gets added to our new object,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,950
since it's no longer in line as part of an object literal.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,840
We're instead using this object that creates syntax.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,850
As of this change,

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,220
we've arrived at the completed prototypal pattern of writing your class.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,130
This is not to be confused with the pseudo-classical pattern,

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,260
which is coming up next.
