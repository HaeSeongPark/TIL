1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,719
So now that we've got this functional shared version of the code,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,280
we're ready to make a change that might improve performance a bit.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,970
Remembering back to how prototype chains work,

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,670
can you think of some way we might improve performance by

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,990
using prototype chains to achieve the same thing that this code achieves?

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,890
As a reminder the way prototypes work is any object can be

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,530
made to delegate its failed property lookups to another object.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,570
So, for example in this situation, if Ben lacks a property it's going to

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,659
delegate any failed lookups for that property to Ben's prototype object
