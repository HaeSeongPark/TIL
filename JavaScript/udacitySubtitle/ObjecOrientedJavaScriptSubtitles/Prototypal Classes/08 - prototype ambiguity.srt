00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,340
Historically, the fact that this property is called dot prototype,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,420
has been very confusing for people learning JavaScript.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,650
By using this word to describe the methods container object,

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,310
that's available on every function,

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,690
JavaScript introduces an ambiguous 2nd meaning for the word prototype.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,240
So if someone says, object ones prototype is object two,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,970
a reasonable interpretation would be to think that field lookups on this

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,310
first object should fall through to the second one.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,370
So, you might say Amy's prototype is car dot prototype, but

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:35,240
this is not the relationship that car has with car dot prototype.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,740
In that case, car is a function object and field lookups on it will fall through

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,940
to some function prototype, where all function objects their field lookups.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,020
The car functions relationship with car-dot-prototype is very different from

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,780
the one that Amy has with car-dot-prototype.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,040
This other relationship reflects the second interpretation of the statement,

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,700
"object one's prototype is object two".

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,522
The relationship is that when a car function runs,

18
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:06,790
it will create objects that delegate their field lookups to car dot prototype.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,706
So in this sense, you might say, cars prototype is car dot prototype.

20
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:14,401
So to review, saying Amy's prototype is

21
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:19,560
car dot prototype means something very different from saying cars prototype is

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,720
car dot prototype even though those sentences look so similar.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,620
We can leave this discussion behind, but

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,780
be aware that it's extremely easy to conflate these two uses of

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,900
the word prototype, and it's well worth investing extra thought in ironing out

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,630
exactly what the differences between the two uses are.
