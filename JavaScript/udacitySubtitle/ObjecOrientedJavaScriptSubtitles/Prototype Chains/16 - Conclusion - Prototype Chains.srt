00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,560
So that's pretty much it for prototype chains.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,320
You should be able to use them to make objects that look very similar to

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,990
other objects.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,990
Which is a useful technique for code sharing and for saving memory.
