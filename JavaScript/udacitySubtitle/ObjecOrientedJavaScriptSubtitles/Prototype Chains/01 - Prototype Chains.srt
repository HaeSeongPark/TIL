Prototype chains are a mechanism for making objects that resemble other objects.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,100
When you want two objects to have all the same properties,

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,190
either to save memory or to avoid code duplication,

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,660
you might decide to copy every property over from one object to another.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,000
But as an alternative, JavaScript provides the option of prototype chains.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,810
This makes one object behave as if it has all

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,800
the properties of the other object,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,040
by delegating the failed lookups from the first object to the second one.
