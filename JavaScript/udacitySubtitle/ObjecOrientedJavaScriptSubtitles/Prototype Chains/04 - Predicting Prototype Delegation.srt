1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,738
Let's try adding a new property to the blue object.

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:05,822
Now of course, when we go to do a lookup on a property that got

3
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:09,490
copied onto the blue object, we get the value we'd expect.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,270
Which was originally copied over from gold.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,079
And it's no different for the property that was added manually by our code.

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,110
As with the gold object, a lookup for

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,160
a property that isn't available on blue should result in undefined.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,795
Let's make another replica of the gold object,

9
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:28,409
this time using a different strategy to achieve that similarity.

10
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:31,379
Rather than copying the properties over one by one,

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,590
the idea would be to give the rose object some linkage to the gold object.

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,820
Such that whenever a requested property can't be found on rose,

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,622
it uses gold as sort of a fall back source of properties.

14
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,540
The Object.create function can create objects for

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,940
you that have this delegation lookup feature.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,600
Just pass in your desired fall back object.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,060
And it produces a new object, the delegates failed lookups to the fallback.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,060
You can still interact with this special new object in the same way you

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,820
would any other regular object.

20
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,480
But when you ask that object for a property that can't be

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,226
found directly on the object itself, it does something rather interesting.

22
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:11,626
The lookup falls through, up the chain to the prototype object.

23
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,270
So what do you think will get logged in this situation?
