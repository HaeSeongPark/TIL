1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,350
The answer is 1.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,022
Since the prototype object does have the property,

3
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:05,930
the lookup ultimately succeeds.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,010
It falls through rose and then is satisfied on the gold object.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,880
And passed out as if the rose object had the property the whole time.
