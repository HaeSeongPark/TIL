00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,140
Let's build up some objects that have a lot of similarities so

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,660
that we can see how prototype chains might help us.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,550
On the right here, I'll show a picture of the objects that we're creating as we

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,220
go and the relationships that they developed.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,490
Here we have a property lookup on the gold object.

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,820
Let's consider every step of what happens when we do a property lookup for

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,530
the key a in this object.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,080
The interpreter kicks off an investigation as to whether or

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,930
not the gold object has the property we're looking for.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,830
Upon inspecting the object, the interpreter could tell that there

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,050
is a pair available in this object that has the key a.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,340
The value that's associated with that pair is 1.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,480
And so the result of this lookup expression is going to be 1.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,280
In this case, our logging system would log value 1 out to the screen somewhere.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,570
My code assumes that there's some function called Log that already exists.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,740
In most environments, you would call it console.log.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,890
But, let's take a look at what happens when we ask for

18
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,130
a property that we know the object doesn't have.

19
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,070
First, that property lookup arrives at the object.

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,550
And then the interpreter acknowledges the failure by providing undefined in

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,030
response to this attempted lookup for z.

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,550
And, so the lookup for z on the gold object,

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,750
results in undefined which is what ultimately gets logged to the screen.
