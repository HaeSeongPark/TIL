1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,960
The copy operation was one time.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,110
So, the relationship between gold and blue was over immediately.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,950
All that remains of those cloning efforts is this A property that we

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,430
copied some time ago.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,180
But, what do you think will happen when we log the Z property of

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:14,960
the rose object?
