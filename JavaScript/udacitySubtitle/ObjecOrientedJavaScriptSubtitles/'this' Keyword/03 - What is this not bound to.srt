00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,280
In order to start asking the question, what does the key word this refer to,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,390
we really need a code example where the keyword this appears.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,070
Here we have it appearing inside a function which is generally how you

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,200
are going to see it.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,820
So if you notice the keyword this appearing somewhere in a function,

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,329
what would you imagine it is bound to?

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,340
Lets go through a quick list of

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,020
things that people frequently think it's bound to although it usual is not.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,130
So first of all you might see this function definition here.

10
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,200
Highlight it in blue, and you know that when your interpreter hits it,

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,090
it's going to create a function object in memory.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,030
You may then conclude that the keyword this should refer to that

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,110
function object, but it doesn't.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,440
As a next step sometimes people conjecture that and

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,460
instance of that function is created and the keyword this refers to it.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,930
Now, in certain circumstances that's true.

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,450
But in order to really get on board with that definition, I would have to ask,

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,110
what is it that you imagine a new instance of this function would be?

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,740
I mean, strictly speaking, what is this object in your mind?

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,300
Later on we're going to go on to examine how this could be considered true but

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,660
it's actually rarely the case that you're going to see code that looks

22
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,500
like this.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,370
So let's say, for the sake of argument.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,200
But this is basically an error, generally speaking.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,550
You might then think that in order for the keyword this to mean anything it

26
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,970
must be in a function that is contained within some other object as a property.

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,730
Here was have an object ob2.

28
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,050
That has a method called method that stores a reference to

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,280
that same function object, so that object creates an object in memory and

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,060
maybe that in memory object, where the function is a property,

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,610
would be the thing that the keyword this refers to.

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,950
This is actually one of the most popular misconceptions.

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,880
But it's also not the case.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,680
And we'll see why in just a minute.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,060
The easiest way to think about this,

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,320
though, is what if that same function was a property of two different objects?

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,880
It doesn't stand to reason that the keyword,

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,100
this, would be forced to choose somehow between the two of them.

39
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,540
Taking it a step further,

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,130
we could then claim that the keyword this will appear inside a function.

41
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,410
And that function must appear inside the curly braces of some object literal.

42
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,610
Or some other form of defining a function.

43
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,530
So that object literal that surrounds the function definition might create an in

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,760
memory object and

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,139
that could be what we're referring to when we say the keyword this.

46
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,850
But this is also not correct.

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,700
Lastly, we know we will eventually call this function, and

48
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,950
as we pass values in to be bound to the positional parameters of the function,

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,330
we could imagine that that invocation creates a set of bindings, or a scope.

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,770
That scope must be modeled somewhere in memory.

51
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,790
And maybe it's represented as an object where a maps to three in this case, and

52
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,600
b maps to four.

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,450
We would either call this an execution context, or a scope.

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,010
But this is also not what the keyword this refers to.

55
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,320
As we recall from our earlier conversation about scopes, it's not the case that

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,300
JavaScript gives you any memory reference access to these constructs.
