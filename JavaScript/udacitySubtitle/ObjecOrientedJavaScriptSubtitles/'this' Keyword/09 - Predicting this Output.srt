1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,040
Furthermore, we wouldn't expect those bindings to remain true across every

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,600
single invocation of this function.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,480
If all of this seems completely obvious to you,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,620
then you're in a great position for understanding the parameter this.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,010
Because in JavaScript,

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,210
the keyword this behaves like a parameter in most of the important ways.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,810
The intuitions that you've built up around how to pass values into a function

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,820
and how they'll get bound to the arguments being passed in at call time,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,780
all those same intuitions will hold true for the parameter this.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,750
So let's keep track of the output that we're expecting to see by putting it

11
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,600
in a code comment here to the right of the line they created.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,620
We're ready to investigate what would happen if our function referred to

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,810
the parameter this inside the function body.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,380
If we pass this as an additional input parameter at the beginning of

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,100
the logging function call, in this case, what should we expect to be logged and

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,260
bound to the parameter this while the fn function is running?

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,500
Go ahead and write out your answer.
