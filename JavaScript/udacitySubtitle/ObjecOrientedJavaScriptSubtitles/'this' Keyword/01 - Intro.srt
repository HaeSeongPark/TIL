00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,900
Every object oriented language I can think of has a way to dynamically refer to

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,170
the current object.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,490
In JavaScript we use the keyword, this.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,740
But as you and I both know, it can be pretty confusing at times.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,160
It doesn't always return the object you're expecting it to.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,690
>> I would actually go so far as to say the parameter,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,440
this, is easily the most widely misunderstood aspect of the language.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
But it's actually pretty easy to use.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,820
If you're thinking about it in the right way.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,360
So you'll notice I'm always very careful to refer to it as the parameter this.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,600
And that's because it behaves almost exactly like a normal parameter,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,240
with a couple of exceptions.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,260
Parameters are those words that we see between parenthesis in

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,610
a function definition.

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,020
So there's really just two major differences between a regular parameter and

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,270
the parameter this.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,980
The first is, you don't get to pick the name for the perimeter this.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,000
It's always just going to be referred to as this.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,980
And the second is, you go about binding values to the perimeter this a bit

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,680
differently from how you bind values to other perimeters.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,100
There's about five different ways, in fact,

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,050
that you can do that and we're going to examine them all in an upcoming lesson.

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,230
But before we do I'd like to just take a quick detour and

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,080
look at the Dev Tools for a moment.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,840
To examine a scenario you might find yourself in where you could start to ask

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,660
the question, what is the parameter this is going to be bound to in this case?
