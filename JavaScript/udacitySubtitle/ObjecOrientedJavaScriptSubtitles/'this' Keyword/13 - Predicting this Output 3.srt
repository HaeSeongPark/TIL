1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,330
Notice that I frequently use the expression left of the dot

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,920
to discuss the idea of finding a focal object during method indication.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,880
But this is just an expression that I use to keep things simple.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,920
But all the same rules would apply,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,340
if you used brackets instead of dots to get access to the method.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,690
Now that we've taken a sidetrack,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,500
the question from before is even more interesting.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,990
If there is no dot,

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,000
then how can we determine what the parameter of this would be bound to?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,790
What do you suspect it might get bound to in this situation?
