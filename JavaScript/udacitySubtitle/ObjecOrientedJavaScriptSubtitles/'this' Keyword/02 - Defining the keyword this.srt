00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's start by discussing what the keyword this is for.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,530
This is an identifier that gets a value bound to it, much like a variable.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,930
But instead of identifying the values explicitly in your code,

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,770
this gets bound to the correct object automatically.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,580
Now mostly, the rules for how the interpreter determines the what

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,450
the correct binding is, resemble the rules for positional function parameters.

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,960
The differences between positional function parameters and

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,150
the keyword this are designed to support your intuition about

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,000
which object should be focal when you're invoking a method or a constructor.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,590
There are a lot of misconceptions out there.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,260
So, let's clear them up by going through a list of the things that

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,680
the keyword this specifically won't be bound to
