1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,009
And now for our final interesting question.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,880
Do we expect that there will be any change to the type of output we get from it

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,420
now that we've already run the second sagas function once before?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,100
What do you think the output will be this time?
