1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,550
In fact this is a bit of a trick question, because there's no way to know what

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:11,340
the output will be until we generate a new blue context for the saga function.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,040
Until we do there will be no binding for

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,550
a variable deed that's relevant to this last invocation of the sagas column.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,960
So none of these deeds will be relevant to the final output of this final

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,100
function call.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,470
Let's see what randomly generated variable it does produce.
