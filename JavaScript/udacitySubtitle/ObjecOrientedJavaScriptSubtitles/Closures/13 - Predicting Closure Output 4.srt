1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,060
We're at another interesting juncture because we're about to run our

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,795
second sagas function for the first time.

3
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:08,330
What do you think is going to happen when we do?

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,310
As usual, it will create a new context for the function invocation.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,790
But that context will exist within the second of the two red contexts that were

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,770
created from calling this red new saga function.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,640
Behavior will proceed as normally until we get to the line that

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,020
does the logging.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,500
What do you expect the output will be?
