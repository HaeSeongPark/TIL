As JavaScript developers we frequently make use of closures which

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,550
are a concept many people find confusing.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,000
Can you explain exactly how closures work?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,440
>> Sure. Put simply, every function should have access to all the variables from

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,470
all the scopes that surround it.

6
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:19,770
A closure is just any function that somehow remains available after those

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,690
outer scopes have returned.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,580
Now that probably sounds at least a little confusing, but

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,340
as we look back at our code we're going to see specific examples of how that

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,020
plays out and how we can use closures in our program.
