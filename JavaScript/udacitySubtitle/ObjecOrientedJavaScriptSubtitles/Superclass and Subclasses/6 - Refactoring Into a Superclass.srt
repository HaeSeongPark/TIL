1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,050
Well, for one thing, the creation of the object and adding

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,500
a loc property seems like something we could do up in the Car constructor.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,540
Where we used to have object creation, we can simply call the Car function now

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,440
and it'll produce an object that can act as the starting point for

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,060
the rest of the subclass.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,320
Technically, we have a working superclass at this point, but

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,610
there's still more repeated code that we should be able to move into it.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,250
Let's take the code for the addition of a move method out of

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,630
those subclass constructors and move it up here into the superclass constructor.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,810
At this point, we have two complete subclass functions and

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,640
one superclass constructor function that creates a bit of a starting point for

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,970
each of those subclasses to build on top of.
