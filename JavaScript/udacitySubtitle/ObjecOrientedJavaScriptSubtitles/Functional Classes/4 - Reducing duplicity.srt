1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,490
The answer is that the parameter This provides us the functionality we need to

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:04,380
achieve that.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,030
The parameter This is going to treat the object found on the left of

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,830
the data call time as a function input.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,860
And therefore, it will provide us a name that we can use to refer to

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,500
that object.
