1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,390
So, we've arrived at the functional class pattern with shared methods, or

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,320
simply the functional shared pattern.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,390
But there's still some cleanup we will probably want to do before it's

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,570
fully refactored.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,150
For one thing,

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,340
we see that there are two places that we have to name the move method.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,070
Once when we build the function in the first place, and

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,550
another time when we decide we want to assign it over onto every car object.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,420
So, if we found ourselves building more functions and assigning each one as

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,440
a property of the object, we would have to name them in two different places.

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,230
There'd be two lists of all of the methods that belong on cars.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,770
This is problematic because you could easily find yourself correctly editing one

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,920
of the lists and forgetting to edit the other.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,550
Perhaps, there's some programmatic way that we could iterate across all of

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,550
the methods that we want to include on every car object and

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,550
add them on automatically as a result of them having been in a list somewhere.

17
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,820
There isn't necessarily a way to iterate over the variables in a scope, and so

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,620
we're going to have to think of something clever.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,640
Maybe we could store all the methods we plan on adding to cars in an object in

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,800
the first place.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
That way, it's easy to iterate over the object programmatically and

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,160
add them all in a single line
