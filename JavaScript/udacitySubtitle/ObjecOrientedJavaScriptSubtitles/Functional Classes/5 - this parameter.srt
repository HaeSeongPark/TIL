00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,260
So now that we've factored our Move method to be outside of the body of

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,170
the car function, what would you expect the parameter of

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,330
this to refer to when we invoke .move on this last line?

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,250
Of course, since Ben is on the left of the dot when we invoke move,

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,900
the parameter of this will be bound to Ben.
