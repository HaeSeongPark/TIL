1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,590
At this point, adding a new method to the Car class is as easy as modifying one

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,410
line of code and then it will automatically be available on the object.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,580
If you're not familiar with the syntax of extend,

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,500
you should look up an implementation that's made available in one of the many

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,590
open source libraries that build this for you.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,430
But know that it is not a native JavaScript function.

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,917
So to keep our example simple, we're going to go back to the old version of

8
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:24,549
the code that only have one method to add to every Car.

9
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:25,930
Let's go back to our diagram.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,853
In these most recent edits, we have gone from having a move variable that stored

11
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:35,820
a function object to instead having a methods variable that stores an object.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,670
And that object has a move property pointing to the same function.

13
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,090
You could say that this is better,

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,290
because the methods object is now capable of storing as many

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,310
difficult methods as you want to have available on every Car instance.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,870
One problem I'm noticing with this code is that the name methods,

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,440
doesn't seem to make it very clear that the methods object is affiliated in

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,140
some way with the Car class.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,610
We could easily confuse it as being perhaps a method container for

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,840
some other class.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,209
Furthermore, in the current code it's a global variable,

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,705
which is something we should avoid.

23
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:11,880
It'll be nice if the methods object was clearly encapsulated somehow along with

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,310
the Car class function,

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,220
such that the two of them were bundled up together nice and neat.

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,860
But it's just as easy to store an object like this methods object,

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,290
as a property of another object as it is to store it in the global variable.

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,440
So, let's use the object features of the Car function to make room for

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,650
the object that stores these methods.

30
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,960
Instead of using a global variable called methods,

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,374
we will instead put a property on the Car function called .methods
