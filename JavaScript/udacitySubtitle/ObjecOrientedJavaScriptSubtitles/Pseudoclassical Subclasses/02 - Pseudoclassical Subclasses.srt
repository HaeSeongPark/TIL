1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,310
Of course, we could simply add code that puts a new function property on

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,560
every single new instance as the constructor is running, but

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,430
this would mean we are creating a lot more function objects than necessary.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,820
Let's use the power of prototype chains to save memory.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,860
Recall that in the pseudo-classical pattern, any properties that you want shared

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,570
across all instances go on the .prototype property of the constructor function.
