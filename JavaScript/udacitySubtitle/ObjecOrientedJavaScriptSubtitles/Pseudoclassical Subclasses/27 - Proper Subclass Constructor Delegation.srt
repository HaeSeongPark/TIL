1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,650
Since this object is not one of the objects that comes for

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,330
free with a function, it does not have it's own .constructor property.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,778
And this lookup would fail and fall through twice, all the way to car.prototype.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:17,630
So since car.prototype.contructor is car, amy.constructor is also car.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,620
What code could you write to resolve this issue?
