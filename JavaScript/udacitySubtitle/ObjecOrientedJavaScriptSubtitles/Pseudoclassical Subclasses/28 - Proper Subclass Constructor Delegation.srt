1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,460
It's as simple as adding a correctly linked .constructor property to that

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,689
prototype object.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,090
Now, lookups for .constructor property would fall through from amy and

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,400
stop when they hit Van.prototype.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,620
They'll report the right constructor because Van.prototype.constructor has been

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,430
set to equal Van.
