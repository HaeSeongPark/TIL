00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,670
Surprisingly, the answer is the car would be logged.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's examine why.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,211
The amy object doesn't have a local dot constructor property, but

4
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:09,451
amy does delegate the van dot prototype.

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,503
Van dot prototype is a brand new object that has been set up to

6
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,370
delegate the Car dot.prototype.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,733
That brand new object does not have its own dot constructor property,

8
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,140
much like any object coming out of Object dot create should not.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,370
At best, it is an object that delegates to an object that has its own dot

10
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,313
constructor property.

11
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:30,650
Car dot prototype has a dot constructor property because every single dot

12
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,530
prototype object that comes for

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,480
free with the function when it's created is given one

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,160
of these dot constructor properties pointing back to the original function
