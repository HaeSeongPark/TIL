00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,430
The answer is that the Car function would run in the context of the global scope

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,535
because this Car function is being invoked as a free function invocation.

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:11,230
. You would actually wind up with a global loc variable pointing to

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,020
the number 9 and your Van instance would be completely unaffected by any

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,200
code within the Car function.
