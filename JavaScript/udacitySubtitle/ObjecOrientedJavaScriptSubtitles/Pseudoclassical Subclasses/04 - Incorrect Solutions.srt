00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm going to take a moment getting around to the answer to this question,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,110
because there is so many different mistakes one can make right here.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,870
Let's explore some of the incorrect options before we arrive at

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,130
the right answer.

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,000
A simple idea might be to repeat the code that we saw in

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,860
the car function right here in the Van subclass constructor.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,630
Since there's so little of it.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,520
Notice this would have the effect of creating a loc property on every instance.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,260
And that loc property would point to the number in question.

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,360
But that's not exactly what we want if it forces us to repeat the same code in

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,320
two different places.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,800
But this poses a few issues.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,110
For one, if you ever change how instantiation works,

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,060
you would have to remember to change both places.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,110
Furthermore, you can tell that the logic here is quite simple, but

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,110
that's just for the purpose of our example.

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,200
In most classes,

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,630
there's going to be a lot more code in a super class constructor.

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,340
You would have to repeat in the subclass.

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,480
So we have a bit of a puzzle on our hands.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,870
We'd really like to simply run the Car function in the middle of

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,380
the Van function.

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,470
But in such a way that it modifies the new van instance that's being created.

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,150
You might suppose we could simply call car the way you normally do

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,720
with the keyword new in front of it.

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
But this is problematic for a couple of reasons.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,950
What would you expect the effect of this technique to

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,120
be on your in-memory model?

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,070
Take a moment to imagine how this code would play out when it's

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,740
actually running.

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,890
For reference, here is the in memory model that we're starting to build up.

32
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,800
The answer is that if we tried to call the Car function with the keyword new,

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,970
it's going to have the effect of creating another new instance object,

34
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,410
in addition to the one that got created in Rhonda JS,

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,040
as a result of calling new van.
