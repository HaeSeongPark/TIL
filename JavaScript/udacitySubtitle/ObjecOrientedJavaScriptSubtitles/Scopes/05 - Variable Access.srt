1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,180
A new lexical scope is created every time you type out a function definition.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,800
The function definition spans from the letter f

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,070
all the way down to this end curly brace.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,060
The two curly braces around the function's body enclosed the area of

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,835
the code where different access rules will apply.

6
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:22,520
Let's color in all the area between these braces to represent the region that

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,100
will have new rules, and that we would thus consider a different lexical scope.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,220
Once you've made a new lexical scope by defining a function,

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,550
it has a few more limits then the lexical scope around it.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,680
Although you can still access variables from the broader lexical scope

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,230
containing that interlexical scope, and

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,450
you can access variables that get defined inside that inner scope, the variables

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,270
that you find in the inner scope can not be referred to from outside that scope.

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,160
Outside these curly braces referring to a variable that

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,770
was local to the inner scope will result in an error.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,570
So, what variables do you think would be available from

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,260
within the body of the new saga function?

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,560
That is to say what variables could you access in between these two

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,390
curly braces.
