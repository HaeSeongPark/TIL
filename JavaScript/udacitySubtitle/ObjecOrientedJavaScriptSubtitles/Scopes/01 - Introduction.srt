Hi, I'm Markus Philips.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,440
I'm the Dean and Co-Founder of Hack Reactor an immersion school for

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,820
software engineering in San Francisco.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,440
We developed an outcome driven and

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,130
data driven approach to education called Rapid Iteration Teaching.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,310
I like to think of myself as the educational equivalent of Brad Pitt in

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,019
Money Ball, but it may be more accurate to compare me to Joanna Hill.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,780
Before founding Hack Reactor, I led technical training initiatives at Twitter,

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,950
worked on their back-end anti-spam systems and led the front-end framework team.

10
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,320
I left Twitter at the end of 2012 to start Hack Reactor and the rest is history.

11
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,620
Every second counts during an immersive program and

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,400
our team has put a ton of thought into the materials that you'll be seeing here.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,330
This course covers the first four days of Hack Reactors 12 week curriculum.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,330
So you'll be getting a taste of the hyper fast learning that leads our students

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,830
to a 99% placement rate.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,860
I consider these lessons the most important fundamental material you can

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,550
have under your belt, before moving towards employment in any JavaScript stack.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,530
So whether you're new to JavaScript programming or

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,880
you've already found it confusing for years.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,730
Together, we're going to find out just how clear and

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,510
easy it can be when you approach it the right way.
