1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,733
We're done listing out the lexical
scopes in this program.

2
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:06,317
We've seen how to differentiate one
lexical scope from another, and

3
00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:08,610
we've learned the rules
that govern them.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,290
It's time to talk about a somewhat
different idea relating to a different

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,320
usage of the word scope.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,309
When a program runs,
it builds up storage systems for

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,030
holding the variables and their values.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,320
These in-memory scope structures
are called execution contexts.
