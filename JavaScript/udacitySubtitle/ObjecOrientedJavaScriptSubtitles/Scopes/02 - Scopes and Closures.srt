1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,070
So we're going to start off by talking about scopes and closures.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,290
Since you really need to fully understand those aspects of functions and

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,552
variable access before we can move on to more advanced topics of

4
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,560
object-oriented programming.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,250
Then we'll discuss the parameter this and prototype delegation, which

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,110
are the two main language features allowing for object-oriented JavaScript.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,280
Finally, we'll cover a number of different ways that you can write JavaScript

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,610
classes and subclasses.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,600
By the end of this,

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,030
you'll have a strong understanding of JavaScript's object-oriented features and

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,110
how the code you write impacts the interpreters in memory model as your

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,880
code is executing.
