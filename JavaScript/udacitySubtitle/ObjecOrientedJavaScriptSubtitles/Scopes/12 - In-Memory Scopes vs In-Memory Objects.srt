1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,210
At this point,
the execution context looks a lot

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,010
like a collection of key value pairs,
sort of like an object.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,670
Now noticing that similarity,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,640
it would be tempting to
think that in memory scopes.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,300
And in memory objects are somehow
actually the same thing.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,510
This is a deceptive similarity,
since the two are kept so

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,260
completely separate by the interpreter.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,620
And there are so many limits on
your access to an execution context

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,240
that don't exist to your
access to an object.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,060
Many of the rules that
we've learned about objects

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,330
will also happen to be true for
execution contexts, but

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,950
you can never mix and
match the two in your programs.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,690
Despite all of the similarities,

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,230
they live in completely different
worlds that almost never interact.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,990
Just as a few examples,
you will never be able to

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,211
store an array full of contexts,
even though you can do so with objects.

17
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:51,795
You can't iterate over the variable
names in an execution context,

18
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:54,760
the way you would over
the keys in an object.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,620
So even though they are both key
value data storage constructs,

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,940
you're going to be interacting with
the two in completely different ways.
