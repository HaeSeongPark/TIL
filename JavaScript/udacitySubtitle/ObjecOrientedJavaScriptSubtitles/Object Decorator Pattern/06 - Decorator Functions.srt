1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,804
So let's think about what other repeated code can be factored out here.

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:08,128
Even though it's a tiny piece of logic, the code that adds a .loc property to

3
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:10,670
a new car object is being written twice here.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,340
How do you think we could go about factoring that out?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,520
Well, we can use the same technique we did of writing a function that does work

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,180
for us over and over again.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,630
Now, I'm going to give this function the name carlike.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,840
Since it's job is to augment an object with the properties needed to be

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,110
considered a car.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,580
Now it's true that in this oversimplified example,

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,280
the function we're going to be writing will do almost nothing.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Since car seems to be pretty simple,

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,030
they really only have a .loc property on them.

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,991
But in a real program, objects have a lot more properties.

15
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,308
So this carlike function should be made to take some car object as an input,

16
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,720
then do some work on it and then return it.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,320
And when we call it on our car objects,

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,760
we expect it to add this .loc property for us.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,520
As such, we'll need a pass the location value into carlike so

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,140
that it knows what to set the car's location to.

21
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,669
When a function like this one, takes in an object as it's input and

22
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:06,276
then augments that object with some properties or functionality.

23
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:09,270
The carlike function here would qualify as a decorator.

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,480
It's common to use adjectives as the names for

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,970
your decorator functions, hence the name carlike
