1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,930
So, at this point, what I want to do is open a second text buffer,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,360
a second file, which I'm going to save as Library.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,200
And, the idea with this is, I want to write code that's going to make it

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,880
simpler for me to write this code later down the line.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,160
I want to write some generalized code that I can consume here in the consumption

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,500
case, such that when I want to increment the location of any car object,

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,110
I can use the code that's written here,

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,160
that's supposed to be general and useful across many situations.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm going to start by writing a function, then I'm going to edit it,

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,220
so that it's capable of moving a car input object for us.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,330
So now, by simply calling that function on our two car objects,

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,690
we have the same effect as we had before, but

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,090
without typing out the incrementation logic each time.

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,610
So now, we don't just have these two car objects being stored in amy and

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,290
ben, we have yet another variable, storing yet another object.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,820
And, this object happens to be a function object.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,780
That function object is what operates on these two simple car objects and

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,180
modifies their .loc property.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,890
At this point,

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,920
it would be very reasonable to wonder what we've actually improved.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,650
It really seems as though there is more code in total here than

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,600
there was a minute ago, and the lines that call, the helper function,

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,860
are just as long as the ones that they replaced.

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,350
There are two important differences that I can think of as to why it's valuable

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,670
to factor repeated code like that out into a function.
