00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,840
Our code now feels a little easier to read because previously the move

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,000
function was stored outside the carlike function.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,860
And it was at a different level of indentation, even though it

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,930
was a property of the object eventually, just like the loc property is.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,060
At this point all the code related to the obj that gets returned is at

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,490
the same level of indentation.
