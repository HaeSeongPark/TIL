00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,700
So Pete, I'm going to talk
element widths for a second.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,970
I've heard that relative widths
are better suited for responsive design.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,610
Why is that?

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,690
>> Sure.
Let's take a look at

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,870
this website for a second.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,940
It's got a beautiful,
panoramic image that's 1200 pixels wide.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,500
On this laptop screen where
the viewport width is 1280 pixels.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,910
No problem, the image fits just fine.

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,460
>> Right.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,850
But now, what happens if you shrink
the browser to a size that's below

11
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,590
the image's native width?

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,460
>> Yeah!
If I'm not careful,

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,605
instead of shrinking and

14
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:35,790
re-scaling the image, the image
will keep its original dimensions.

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,340
Users will need to stroll left and
right to see the whole image.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:39,890
>> Oh.

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,560
That's ugly and annoying.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,650
>> Yeah.
It's not a good experience.

19
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,045
On the Nexus 7, about a third of
the image is going to get cut off, but

20
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:52,345
on something like an iPhone 5, the users
going to see less than half the image.

21
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,395
They're going to have to scroll left and
right to see the whole thing.

22
00:00:56,395 --> 00:01:01,185
Since CSS pixels vary so widely across
all these different devices, you

23
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:05,785
shouldn't count on a specific viewport
width for your content to render well.

24
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:10,230
Large CSS widths or
even absolute positions can result in

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,960
elements that are either too big or
don't fit on the screen at all.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,160
This is why you should use
relative positions instead of

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,164
absolute positions such as width 100%.
