1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,780
Do you remember my personal site from
the beginning of the first lesson?

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,980
Well, it looks like there
are some issues with it.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,380
When I opened it up to test on mobile,
in this case, a Nexus 5.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,860
It looks awful.

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,370
See how I have to scroll back and
forth to see the whole page?

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,120
The page defaulted to desktop
resolutions, which does not look so

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,950
awesome on this mobile viewport.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,330
For this quiz,
open up this site with mobile dev tools.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,340
Add a viewport, so
that it doesn't look totally awful.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,430
You will know you've done it correctly
when the page actually fits,

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,470
when you try to emulate a mobile device.

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,830
Additionally, when you've
set the viewport correctly,

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,330
a code will be displayed,
type it in below to continue.
