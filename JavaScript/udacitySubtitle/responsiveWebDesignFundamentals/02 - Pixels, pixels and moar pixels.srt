1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,670
Instead of reporting the width in
the number of physical hardware pixels,

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,150
the browser reports the width
in the number of DIPs, or

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,190
device independent pixels.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,118
As its name implies,
a device independent pixel is a unit of

5
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:19,453
measurement, that actually relates
pixels to a real distance.

6
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:24,847
The idea being that a device
independent pixel will take up the same

7
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:31,032
amount of space on a display regardless
of the pixel density of the display.

8
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:34,052
>> So if there are twice as
many hardware pixels across as

9
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:36,468
there are pixels
reported by the browser,

10
00:00:36,468 --> 00:00:40,700
the chromebook pixel must have
a device pixel ratio of two.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,400
>> Right.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,540
The browser has a view
port width of 1280 dips.

13
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,740
The 1280 dips get scaled
up to 2560 hardware pixels.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,680
When the page is
rendered on the display.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,140
>> Back to my un-optimized website.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,960
What's the browser doing,
when the viewport isn't set?

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,769
>> Unless you tell the browser
that your site was designed to

18
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,720
work on a small screen it
assumes that they weren't.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,470
And renders the page, as if it were
on a screen that were 980 DIPs wide.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Now, imagine that content
being scaled to fit on

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,640
a phone that's only 360 DIPs wide.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,130
It gets scaled to less than half.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,280
Yuck.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,960
It then tries to make
the content look better,

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,670
by doing something called font boosting.

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,980
The browser tries to pick the primary
content on the page and scale it up.

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,790
>> Oh, wait a second.

28
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,610
So now the browsers actually trying to
guess at what content is important?

29
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,350
Sounds like a problem.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,980
>> Yep.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,260
That means that some fonts are large and
easy to read.

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,200
While others remain small,
and are really hard to read.

33
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,890
Users will have to spend a lot of
time pinching to zoom in order,

34
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,300
to see and interact with the content.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,060
>> That is not ideal.

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,560
>> Nope.
