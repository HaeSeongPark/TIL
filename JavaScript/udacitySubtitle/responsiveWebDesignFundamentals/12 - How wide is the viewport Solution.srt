1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,220
To start with, the viewport on
the Phone is about 320 pixels,

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,730
which is 640 divided by 2.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,280
For the Phablet, or

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,400
the Phone tablet, anything around
about 300 is going to be accepted.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,510
Sometimes device manufacturers fudge
the numbers just a little bit,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,740
which is going to give you fractions.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,740
So, anything around 300's fine.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,070
The Tablet's pretty easy.

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,320
It's device pixel ratio is 1,

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,360
which means that it's viewport
is the same size as its width.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,170
So 1024 pixels.

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,020
And same thing for the Laptop.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,850
With a device pixel ratio of 1 and and

14
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,190
a browser width of 800 pixels, you'll
get a viewport width of 800 pixels.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,240
Notice on the Laptop that the whole
screen is larger than the browser.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,820
But the viewport is only
about the browsers width,

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,360
not the whole screen, so
it's just 800 pixels.
